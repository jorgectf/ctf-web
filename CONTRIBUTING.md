## How to contribute

### Making changes

To contribute, please follow these steps:
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Make your changes
4. Add yourself to the [contributors](#contributors) list
5. Commit and push your changes
6. Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

### Adding writeups

We do not host any writeups directly on the gitbook. Instead, we provide links to the writeup author's blog. Additionally, for added stability and access to historical versions, we use [Web Archive](http://web.archive.org/) links as an alternative means to access content. With this approach, we ensure that if there are any changes to the author's blog, like domain name or URL alterations in the future, you'll still be able to access the content through the provided links.

### Suggesting changes

Even though this place is built from community pull requests, if you don't want to go through the hassle of forking and cloning, you can also suggest changes by opening an [issue](https://github.com/jorgectf/ctf-web/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=suggestion.yml&title=%5BSuggestion%5D%20).

# CTF Web wiki

This place aims to be the single source of knowledge for web challenges in CTFs. Given the recent events in social media platforms such as X (formerly known as Twitter), the security research community has been more and more concerned about the future of knowledge sharing.

From writeups, through tools, to research papers, everything is welcome! If you want to contribute, please read the [How to contribute](/CONTRIBUTING.md) section.
